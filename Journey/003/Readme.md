Resource: AWS Lambda Foundations 

Important Points:

 Lifecycle of Lambda Function: Cold Start and warm start
 
 Cold Start:it invokes the function, bootstrapped your function, execute it and freezes
 
 Warm Start : when function invokes again, it skip the bootstramp process, just pick up the code off cold start(freezes)
 
 Keeping this session short, will spend more time in next two days
