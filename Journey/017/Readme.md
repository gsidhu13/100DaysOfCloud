**EVENTS**

  - AWS schedule instances termination, reboot, stop, maintenance and retirement. All thos scheduled events will be listed here.
  
**Instances**
  
  - All the instances are listed here, if an instance has been terminated recently, it will be listed for a little and then it will disappear. All running, stopped, hibernated will always be here
  
  - Settings icon at top right corner lets you modify instance's attribute
